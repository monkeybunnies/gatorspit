	OPTCON is an algorithm for solving unconstrained control problems. It based on a study by Hager and Zhang, a new conjugate gradient method CG_DESCENT was produced. This algorithm can obtain even higher convergence speed than the ordinary conjugate gradient method and has relatively low memory requirement in computation.

	For algorithm design and performance analysis please refer to OPTCON.pdf. Optcon1.0.tar.gz is the version 1 of the implementation using C. Website reference for this work, please visit here, http://clas.ufl.edu/users/hager/papers/Control/
